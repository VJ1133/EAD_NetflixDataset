# EAD_NetflixDataset
Exploratory data analysis is a process of identifying the missing , outliers in the data and
cleaning the data. Finally, visualize the data and get the insights from the large data. I
have done Exploratory data analysis(EDA) on dataset from Kaggle website called Netflix
Movies and TV Shows .For this EDA we used Python as our primary language , libraries
like pandas , NumPy , plotly , seaborn for the visualization of the data and for development
environment we used the Jupyter notebook
